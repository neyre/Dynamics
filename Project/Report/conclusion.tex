\section{Conclusion}
Using Lagrangian energy methods, we successfully created a mathematical model featuring a set of coupled ordinary differential equations of motion for the dynamic compound triple pendulum system.  These equations of motion were simulated in MATLAB to create a numerical model of the system.
After tuning damping parameters, the model fit experimental data from the real compound triple pendulum almost perfectly for upwards of ten seconds. 
The behaviour of the model shows that the inclusion of damping forces significantly alters the dynamics of the system after the first few seconds, supporting our hypothesis.  In conclusion, the results of our work supported our hypothesis and we consider this project a success.
