\noindent Compound triple pendulums are an obvious extension of the common choatic double pendulum problem. In this project, we model a planar compound triple pendulum both with and without viscous damping forces.  Using Lagrangian energy methods, we derive coupled ordinary differential equations of motion for the system and submit them to numerical integration in MATLAB to model the dynamics of the system. We use an experimental test setup with motion tracking  to collect experimental data for a compound triple pendulum which we compare to the simulated results.  After tuning the damping constants of the model to match those of the system, we acheived extremely close agreement between the model and the experimental results.  The inclusion of damping in the system significantly changes the dynamics, highlighting the system's chaotic nature.
